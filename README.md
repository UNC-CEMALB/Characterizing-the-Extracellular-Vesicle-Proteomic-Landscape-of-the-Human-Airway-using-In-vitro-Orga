# Characterizing the Extracellular Vesicle Proteomic Landscape of the Human Airway using In vitro Organotypic Multi-Cellular Models 

> Analyses used to investigate tri and co culture organotypic models of the alveolar capillary region (ACR) of the lung and determine if these can be indicators of EV proteomic modulations

> All analyses in this respository are designated by their figure number or table number in the manuscript in parantheses.
