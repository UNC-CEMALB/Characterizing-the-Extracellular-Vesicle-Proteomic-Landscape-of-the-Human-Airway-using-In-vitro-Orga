# Characterizing the Extracellular Vesicle Proteomic Landscape of the Human Airway using In vitro Organotypic Multi-Cellular Models 

> Analyses used to investigate tri and co culture organotypic models of the alveolar capillary region (ACR) of the lung and determine if these can be indicators of EV proteomic modulations

> All analyses in this respository are designated by their figure number or table number in the manuscript in parantheses.

# 1. PDF Data Visualization (Figure 2)
- Figure of extracted PDF data visualizing unexposed tri-culture and co-culture groups
- Tested for differences between groups using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests

# 2. Proteomics Data Processing
- Normalized, implemented background filters, imputed missing proteomics data, and removed sample outliers

# 3. Group Distribution Analysis (Table S1 & S2)
- Used Wilcoxon rank sum tests to compare protein abundance distributions between co-culture unexposed and tri-culture unexposed models
- Calculated overall log2 transformed abundances and stratified by set (co-culture and tri-culture)
